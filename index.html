<h3>Against artificial intelligence in weapons: writings 1985 -- 87</h3>

Many years ago I wrote some articles and a long book chapter
to explain -- and argue against -- proposals 
to develop artificial intelligence for military weapons.  They are 
collected here out of personal and historical interest.
</p>

<p>
<a href="star_wars_atlantic.pdf">The "Star Wars" Defense Won't Compute</a>,
<em>The Atlantic</em>, Vol. 255 No. 6, June 1985, pages 18 -- 30.

<p>
I believe this was the first article in a popular publication to explain that
computing and software would be a serious problem for the Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI, or "Star Wars"). In addition to reporting on SDI,  it also
explains artificial intelligence and the problems of  software reliability to
non-specialists.
</p>

<p>
(SDI was a proposal for space-based missile defense that received enormous
attention in the 1980s.  It was never built.)

<a href="sdi_boston_debate.pdf">Debate on Computing Requirements of
Star Wars</a>, <em>The CPSR Newsletter</em>, Vol. 3 No. 4, Fall 1985,
pages 1, 10 -- 11.
</p>

<p>
I attended this debate on SDI computing at MIT, that featured four prominent
computer scientists.  It was reported in the national press, including
<em>The New York Times</em>.  My report includes more of what the participants
said, and how the audience responded.
</p>

<p>
<a href="strategic_computing.pdf">The Strategic Computing Program</a>, in
<em>Computers in Battle: Will They Work</em> edited by David Bellin and Gary
Chapman, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1987, pages 171 -- 208, 333 - 337.
</p>

<p>
The Strategic Computing Program was another military  project
active at the same time as SDI, devoted to applying
artificial intelligence and other speculative technologies to weapons.
This book chapter provides a short history of its sponsor
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and explains its central
role in launching American computer science research.
The chapter describes the political background and content of the program
itself, and discusses the tensions that arose when the formerly  
benevolent sponsor of generic research became militant
and politicized.  It reports on criticism of the program, the belligerent
responses of its advocates in the Defense Department, and the rationalizations,
evasions, and misdirections of its allies among the computer scientists.
<p>

<p>
This chapter (and the <em>Atlantic</am> article) also report on the claims
and expectations for artificial intelligence that were being made in the 1980s.
